Top-level domain (TLD) servers.
For each of the top-level domains - top-level domains such as com, org, net, edu, and gov, and all of the country top-level domains such as uk, fr, ca, and jp - there is TLD server (or server cluster). The company Verisign Global Registry Services maintains the TLD servers for the com top-level domain, and the company Educause maintains the TLD serversfor the edu top-level domain. The network infrastructure supporting a TLD can be large and complex; see [Osterweil 2012] for a nice overview of the Verisign network. See [TLD list 2016] for a list of all top-level domains. TLD servers provide the IP addresses for authoritative DNS servers.
