1. Top-level domain (TLD) servers.
2. For each of the top-level domains - top-level domains such as com, org, net, edu, and gov, and all of the country top-level domains such as uk, fr, ca, and jp - there is TLD server (or server cluster). The company Verisign Global Registry Services maintains the TLD servers for the com top-level domain, and the company Educause maintains the TLD serversfor the edu top-level domain. The network infrastructure supporting a TLD can be large and complex; see [Osterweil 2012] for a nice overview of the Verisign network. See [TLD list 2016] for a list of all top-level domains. TLD servers provide the IP addresses for authoritative DNS servers.
3. Authoritative DNS servers.
4. Every organization with publicly accessible hosts (such as Web servers and mail servers) on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses.
5. An organization's authoritative DNS server houses these DNS records.
6. An organization can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server to hold these records; alternatively, the organization can pay to have these recores stored in an authoritative DNS server of some service provider.
7. Most universities and large companies implement and maintain their own primary and secondary (backup) authoritative DNS server.
